    personal_statement: 
      personal_statement: "I have a passion for working with computers, which I have developed from an early age. I created my first PHP application when I was just 16. Since then I have become very experienced in all aspects of web technologies. Two years ago I was introduced to Ruby on Rails and I 'fell in love' with the language. I appreciate it`s clarity, its simplicity, it`s ease of use as well as it`s impressive capabilities and associated active community. When programming I endeavour to make every code as clear and logicaly as posible. I am fully conversant with many design patterns as well as the organising principles associated with general codes. I know everything there is to know about HTML 5 and CSS 3. With my backend skills in developing programmes and their frontend application I have a strong sense of what is possible when developing a programme and the knowledge to make it work."
